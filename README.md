# nostrhitch

Some python code to fetch hitchmap.com's sqlite dump and post data as nostr notes.
These notes should show up in https://notes.trustroots.org/


## Setup

```
cp settings.py.example settings.py
```

Add your `nsec` to `settings.py`.


On Debian/Ubuntu you might need this:

```
apt install python3.XX-venv
```


Set up the virtual environment with Python 3.12:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run it:

```
python nostrhitch.py
```


## Status - 2024-11

The script is posting nightly from `npub12vz4acq3a94qpfc9kwp98wwtces5ej7n0h6d44pwc6dmucyvggyses5uyk`.

There's also hitchwiki notes, coming from `npub1zmd4ydxpmkqg9ztm6tfph0kyhqz36txs8cjtsxd22geqwl2y8k5s7x6qpm`, generated by https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hwpybot

Both of these are sending out kind 30399 events to relay.trustroots.org. See https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots/blob/main/docs/Events.md
Not sure if there are currently any other apps besides https://github.com/trustroots/nostroots that can do something useful with these notes, besides e.g. https://lightningk0ala.github.io/nostr-wtf/query

We can consider sending out kind 1 notes, to make this hitch stuff visible in the nostr social media sphere.
