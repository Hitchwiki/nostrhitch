This is a spot where you can ask drivers waiting for a ferry to Germany. Maybe already have your ticket ready? I tryed for a while, but drivers seemed to be quite anoyed. So I decided to walk to pedestrian ferry teminal. Half way there I saw a CZ car  at a gas station so I asked the man if I can go with him to Prague. He said YES! I bought a single passanger ticket on-line and was ready to go.\r\n   About ferry tickets. TT-line is in general cheaper than Stenaline. As a driver it is possible to by ,,flexi, add-on\"" ticket, than it is possible to add extra passanger free of extra fee, but still that new passanger must be paid for. Good option might be to buy a pedestrian ticket forehand and than HH at this spot or give it a chance once on board. \r\n        I was takeing the TT-line ferry maybe 10 times as a driver. There is a ticket control at port gate (not necessary operated by human). And I have never experienced ticket control  once on board. So there is a chance to slip in on board and travel for free if you are lucky."""

I always leave Montpellier from there. You can go to the west (Béziers, Narbonne, Toulouse, Perpignan...)  or the east and north (Nîmes, Marseilles, Lyon ...)This time I had a sign \""Toulouse\"" and got a ride directly to Frouzins (south west of Toulouse). A guy solo with just one place.  This day I hitchiked with a French girl going from Marseilles to Toulouse. We had to separate since the guy had just one place. If you read this message, I hope you got a lift and could manage to reach Toulouse on time ;) """
